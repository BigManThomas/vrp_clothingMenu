Clothing UI that uses RageUI(https://github.com/iTexZoz/RageUI) - Required.
Uses mysql-async(https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async) - Required

Uses vrp framework, only for the databse so can be easily made standalone.
 
Any custom weapons will need to be added to the config file, or they will be lost when changing into saved clothes/peds.
